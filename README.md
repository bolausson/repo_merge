# repo_merge
A command-line tool that walks a local Git repository and merges its text files into one or more Markdown part files suitable for ingestion by an LLM or for archival. The tool preserves file contents, includes metadata (size and SHA‑1), respects `.gitignore` by default, and can produce a tree-style summary and a ZIP archive of the outputs.
